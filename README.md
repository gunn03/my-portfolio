# **My Portfolio Page**

This project show cases a lot of what i have learnt so far during this course. Its a portfolio page that will represent me and will be updated constantly as i gain more knowledge of web developing as i progress through this course. The page has a simple scrolling style layout and is easy to use either with a mouse or a touch pad, the navigation bar also makes scrolling easy with one click it will take the user straight to the section. It has a Get In Touch section which allows the user to interact and send details and even a message.

# **UDX**

This project is completely responsive on both a desktop and mobile.

I used a single scroll page rather than a page that opens new tabs, making it easy for the user to navigate.

I have used the scroll-snap-type attribute in css, this snaps a section into view as the user scrolls through the page. 

I have used a Nav Bar toggle for tablet view and smaller, this is to decrease clutter and content overload for the user.

# **Deployment** 
This website was creating using Visual Studios (Vscode), a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
